# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Excel project provides insights into the performance of the coffee shop, the most popular products, and customer behavior to help make informed decisions about product offerings, marketing strategies, and resource allocation. In this data analysis project, I have used Microsoft Excel to analyze the sales data of a fictional coffee shop. The project includes an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics to help gain insights and make informed business decisions.
# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze the sales data of a coffee shop to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can be used to optimize decision-making. The dashboard includes various analyses such as sales trends, product category distribution, customer footfall, order sizes, and store-wise performance. The analysis is presented in a visually intuitive format to facilitate easy interpretation and understanding.
# Data
The data used in this project is a fictional sales dataset of a coffee shop. The dataset contains information about total sales, footfall, product categories, order sizes, and store locations. The data has been structured and visualized in a way that allows for efficient analysis and data-driven decision-making.
